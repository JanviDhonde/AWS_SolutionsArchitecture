## AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Virtual Experience Program 
**AWS_SolutionsArchitecture:** <br>
Completed the AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Virtual Experience, where I designed scalable hosting architectures using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, created architecture diagrams, and communicated technical details in plain language. Gained insights into AWS pricing, cost estimation, and client communication, enhancing my cloud architecture skills..

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository documents my participation in the **AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Virtual Experience Program** on the Forage platform. During this program, I gained hands-on experience in designing scalable and simple hosting architectures using AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk. I also practiced technical communication by explaining my design choices and cost estimations to clients.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Designing Scalable Hosting Architecture with Elastic Beanstalk**  
   - Designed a hosting architecture for a rapidly growing client facing slow response times, using **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** to deploy scalable web applications efficiently. The architecture was tailored to address performance challenges while supporting the client's growth.

2. **Architecture Diagram Creation**  
   - Created a detailed **architecture diagram** to visualize the proposed solution, ensuring that the client could easily understand the technical components and interactions of the architecture.

3. **Technical Communication & Client Explanation**  
   - Drafted an email in **plain language** to explain the architecture design, focusing on making complex technical details understandable for non-technical clients. Included cost calculations and explained how the architecture would scale with client growth.

4. **AWS Pricing Models**  
   - Gained insight into AWS pricing models, ensuring the proposed solution was cost-effective and aligned with the clientâ€™s business needs. Estimated the costs involved based on AWS resources and services selected.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Architecture Design**: Designed scalable and simple architecture to address a client's performance challenges using AWS solutions, particularly Elastic Beanstalk.
- **AWS Services**: Familiarized myself with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, and other services, focusing on how to architect solutions that can scale with business growth.
- **Technical Communication**: Drafted clear, concise, and understandable explanations for clients with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **AWS Pricing & Cost Estimation**: Developed the ability to estimate and communicate the costs of AWS solutions, ensuring they are both scalable and cost-effective.
- **Client Relations**: Gained experience in understanding the critical relationship between CTOs and AWS Solutions Architects, with a focus on reducing client stress by providing thoughtful solutions.

**Skills Developed:**
- **Cloud Architecture**: Strengthened my understanding of cloud architecture principles and how to design solutions that are scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient using AWS.
- **Cost Management**: Learned how to balance performance and cost when proposing AWS-based solutions.
- **Communication**: Enhanced my ability to explain complex technical topics in a clear and digestible way for clients and stakeholders.
- **AWS Cloud Solutions**: Deepened my knowledge of AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, and other cloud tools to design solutions that meet client needs.

**Objective:**  
This repository reflects my learning and experience gained during the **AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Virtual Experience Program**. I am excited to apply these skills in designing cloud architectures as a **Solutions Architect** at AWS, helping businesses scale effectively while managing costs.
